Sessions feed into schools and schools feeds sessions into type of subject.

### Description

The visual shows the distribution of sessions into each school, and then how those schools use those sessions (English, Math, Behavior).

### Key Findings

PPA charter has the most sessions, and it looks very evenly split between English and Math. 
Initiative Chater has the most sessions in English.  
BC charter is the school with the least amount of sessions.  
Sessions in English are the most prominant across all schools.  
BC Charter has the least amount of sessions in English.  

### Next steps

Check how sessions have helped improve academic performance in schools.

### Predictions

BC charter has the least amount of sessions in English, and I wonder how that is going to effect the data when looking into how those interventions helped their scores in English.
